# Gabor-Bandit Task

This repository contains the task code of the Gabor-Bandit task. For the corresponding analysis code, go to the [gaborbandit_analysis](https://github.com/rasmusbruckner/gaborbandit_analysis) repository.

## Getting Started

To start the task, run the *gaborBandits* script. Here you can control the task parameters. 

### Prerequisites

A simple version of the task was created in the PsychoPy Builder and then further extended in the PsychoPy Coder.
